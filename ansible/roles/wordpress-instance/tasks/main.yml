#
# What to do to install and configure a WordPress instance
#
# **This is the “main“ file that tells Ansible what to do to set
# up a WordPress site.** (Or, in Ansible lingo: this is the
# main tasks list for the `wordpress-instance` role).
#
# Operations in this file will be executed in the sequence they are
# written in, for each site stipulated by the `-l` command-line flag
# (or absent that flag, all sites in the inventory) - Subject to their
# `when:` clauses and command-line-specified tags (`-t`), and with
# parallel execution at the level of one task. That is (skipping the
# tasks that have the `never` tag, which as the name implies, can
# only be triggered manually):
#
# - first, the `wordpress_facts` will be assessed on all targeted sites;
#
# - then (and only after the previous step has completed for all
#   targeted sites), Ansible will make sure that all targeted sites
#   exist (by calling `create.yml`);
#
# - then, Ansible will create the `wp` symlink and the wp-content
#   subdirectories, again only if said symlinks and directories don't
#   already exist (`serving-infrastructure.yml`);
#
# - then Ansible will update the database and do some mundane
#   configuration work (`configure.yml`), unless the operator
#   forgot to set `wp_destructive` to include "config" (this
#   is the meaning of the `when:` clause);
#
# - etc.
#
# Once the procedure is complete, every targeted site should be in a
# nominal, ready-to-serve state.
#
# Note that some Ansible tasks (in particular in `plugins.yml`) may
# interfere with user-supplied configuration; in which case, they will
# be guarded by a suitable `when:` clause, which ensures that we do
# nothing if the user already took the matters in their own hands.
