# The administrator shall use the command line to set wp_destructive,
# for instance like this: (in bash)
#
#   -e '{"wp_destructive": {"some-hapless-wordpress": "wipe"}}'
#
# (Be sure to use double quotes â€” Single quotes are *not* valid to
# escape JSON strings.)
#
# The value shall be a map from target names or group names (out of
# the inventory files or scripts) to a keyword among "none" (the
# default), "config", "wipe", "data-and-code", "code-only" or
# "data-only" indicating the level of destructive access requested for
# this WordPress instance. "wipe" means to completely and
# unconditionally delete everything; "data-and-code" and "data-only"
# allows restores from backup. "data-and-code" resp. "code-only" allow
# upgrading plugins and themes, in addition to resp. instead of data.
# "config" means only enforce simple configuration changes, such as
# setting up strict permissions and disabling unused services. "none"
# means do no changes, yet doesn't preclude always-harmless mutations
# such as creating a WP site that did not yet exist.
#
# To use this file say
#
# - include_vars:
#     file: wp-destructive.yml
