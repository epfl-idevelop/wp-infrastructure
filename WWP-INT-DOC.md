#Feature: wwp-int

#This feature allows restoring from backups on a sandbox openshift cluster

##GOAL:
  - restore the production's infrastructure from source code on a test cluster

##PREREQUISITES:
  - python 3 with pyyaml library(for inventory and filters)
  - a working oc client
  - a working ansible installation
  - be positioned on the *feature/wp-int* branch from the *epfl-idev* repo
  - current-context must be "wwp-int/pub-os-exopge-epfl-ch:443/<yourUsername>":
	use "oc config current-context" to check the current context
	use "oc config use-context <context_name>" to choose context
	use "oc login" to login to the desired context
  - once the mgmt pod is running, as well as the httpd pod corresponding to the wordpress instances to be restored:
       export mgmt ssh port to desired local port using the --ssh-port <local_port> option of the wpsible script.
       (you may need to adapt other ansible scripts to detect this port configuration, it is currently dynamically set in wp-int)

##USAGE:
  - first navigate to the ` ansible` directory: `cd wp-ops/ansible`

  - if wwp-int cluster is empty:
      `./wpsible` (or `./wpsible -l wp-blue` will only deploy mgmt with:
       - mount on production backup nas in /backups
       - mount on wwp-int's persistent volume provision system in /srv

  - if mgmt is deployed AND mgmt pod is running (if not, deploy mgmt manually on the OKD console or use "oc rollout latest dc/mgmt"):
      - if respective wordpress servers are NOT deployed:
         "./wpsible" will deploy all httpd deployments only (permission for creating file structure will be denied)
      - if respective wordpress servers ARE deployed:
         "./wpsible" will deploy all httpd deployments AND wordpress instances gathered from /backup mount

      - to limit httpd server deployments :
       "./wpsible -l '<server_name1>, <server_name2>..' " where <server_name#> is of the form httpd-[environment]

      - to limit wordpress instances :

	* `./wpsible -l '<instance_name1>, <instance_name2> ...' --connector <connector> --ssh-port <port>` where <instance_name#> is the name of the backup 
	  folder for the specific instance (fetched from /backups), and where <connector> is the desired mean of connexion, `ssh` or `oc`,
          and where <port> is the local port on which you desire to forward the ssh port of the mgmt pod.
		example: 
			./wpsible -l  _srv_www_www.epfl.ch_htdocs --connector ssh --ssh-port 2222
			./wpsible -l '_srv_www_www.epfl.ch_htdocs, _srv_www_www.epfl.ch_htdocs_about' --connector ssh --ssh-port 2222
       /!\ `--connector` option is *not* optional for wordpress instances and is *ignored* for other inventories (httpd pods and mgmt)

	* "./wpsible -l '<environment1>, ...' " where <environment1> is the name of the group of wordpress instances
		example: 
			./wpsible -l httpd-www
			./wpsible -l 'httpd-www, httpd-inside'

	* edit the python dynamic inventory ansible/inventory/wp-int/wordpress-instances:
	  - call `generate_inventory(sorted= True, limit=0, max_depth=-1)` (bottom of the file)
	    `sorted` will sort instances by file depth, 
	    `limit` will truncate instance lists in each group until the specified number. A value of 0 will not limit instances number 
	    `max_depth` will filter instances by file depth. A depth strictly smaller than 0 will not filter instances, 0 yields root 
	     wordpress directories only, ect.

   - to get an inventory listing for a given dynamic inventory:
      structured:
        ansible-inventory -i <inventory_script> --graph
      full variable listing:
        ansible-inventory -i <inventory_script> --list
